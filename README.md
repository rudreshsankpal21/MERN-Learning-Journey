# MERN Learning Journey

Hi there! I'm rudresh sankpal. currently learning the MERN stack and this repository is a collection of everything I'm doing as I go—from basics to building projects. I'm still a beginner, but I'm serious about improving every day, and this is my way of tracking progress and sharing what I'm learning with others.

## Why I Created This Repo

When I started learning web development, I felt overwhelmed by how much there was to learn. I created this repo to:

- Keep track of my progress
- Stay motivated by seeing how far I've come
- Share my code and notes with other learners
- Build a solid foundation step-by-step

This is not a "perfect" guide—it's raw, real, and evolving as I grow.
